To perform a full backup of a MySQL database and restore it to a different server, we can use the mysqldump command to create a SQL dump file containing the database structure and data, then transfer that file to the new server and import it into a newly created database on that server using the mysql command.

we can use the following steps:

1) Backup on the Source Server:

open the terminal and write the command: 
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup_filename.sql

**
username = MySQL usernane
database_name = name of the databse which needs backup
backup_filename.sql = name of the backup file
**

2) Transfer the Backup File:
Transfer the backup .sql file to the target server.


3) Restore the Backup:
On the target server, restore the database using the mysql command:
mysql -u username -p database_name < /path/to/destination/backup_filename.sql

**
username = MySQL usernane
database_name = name of the databse which needs backup
backup_filename.sql = name of the backup file
