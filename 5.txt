Possible Causes of the Permission Issue
Incorrect File Permissions:

The files or directories within /public/images may not have the correct read permissions for the user running the Nginx process.
Incorrect Ownership:

The files or directories may not be owned by the correct user or group that Nginx runs as.
Directory Permissions:

The parent directories of /public/images might not have the correct permissions, preventing Nginx from traversing the path.
SELinux or AppArmor Restrictions:

On systems using SELinux or AppArmor, additional security policies might restrict access to the files.





Steps to Resolve the Issue
1. Check Nginx User
Find out the user Nginx is running as. This is typically defined in the Nginx configuration file (e.g., /etc/nginx/nginx.conf).
=> grep 'user ' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

2. Check and Correct Ownership
Ensure that the /var/www/html directory and its subdirectories are owned by the correct user and group. For example, if Nginx runs as www-data, the ownership should be:
=> sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html

3. Check and Correct Permissions
Set appropriate permissions for files and directories. For serving static files, a common setup is:

Directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
=> sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
=> sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;


4. Check Parent Directory Permissions
Ensure that the parent directories also have the correct permissions. For example, if /var/www/html is accessible:
=> sudo chmod 755 /var/www
=> sudo chmod 755 /var/www/html


5. Check SELinux or AppArmor
SELinux: Check if SELinux is enforcing and whether itâ€™s causing issues.
=> sestatus

To temporarily disable SELinux:
=> sudo setenforce 0

To set proper SELinux context for the files:
=> sudo chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html

AppArmor: Check AppArmor profiles and adjust if necessary.
=> sudo aa-status

To allow Nginx to access files, you might need to adjust the profile or disable it for testing:
=> sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.nginx


6. Restart Nginx
After making changes, restart Nginx to apply them:
=> sudo systemctl restart nginx






Necessary Permissions for /var/www/html
To ensure that Nginx can serve all static files securely:

Directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
Allows Nginx to traverse directories and list files.

Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
Allows Nginx to read files.
